Holding 'Em Close:
An Interactive Bar Chart Analyzing Pickoff Attempts

Filter by Minor League Level to view lead distance variations between the three parts of a pickoff (before the pickoff, the pickoff, and after the pickoff) and how the numbers vary between league level and pitcher handedness. Compute Z-tests and ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests to determine the significance of the different variables coming in to play to determine the lead distance vs pickoff data.
